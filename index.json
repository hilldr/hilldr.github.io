We call this problem symbiosis. The primary solution to this problem is mutualism, which intimately links the survival of individual organisms and as a result has shaped the evolution of both bacterial and multicellular life.\nThis interplay is central to the maturation and function of the human gastrointestinal tract. Our guts are colonized by mutualistic and other bacteria at birth. These bacteria come from a variety of sources, including our moms and other family members, our environment, and the things we eat early in life. Once these bacteria arrive in our guts, some of them grow rapidly and begin to form dense communities with increasing abilities to help us process the food we eat, regulate our immune response, and many other functions that we have recently begun to understand. At the same time, our intestines are maturing rapidly by generating digestive cells, secreting protective mucus and antimicrobial compounds, and formulating adaptive immune protections that will affect us for the rest of our lives.\nThe interplay between microbial colonization and expansion in the gut and the development of the gut itself has been difficult to study. There are no germ-free human research subjects. In my research I apply innovate cell culture model systems that allow us to grow germ-free human intestinal tissue in the lab. Our work has shown that these tissues can sustain symbiosis with mutualistic bacteria and that this relationship kickstarts maturation of the lining of the human intestine.\nI am currently using this system to explore the factors that contribute to the failure of the intestinal maturation in some premature infants. Identification of specific conditions that determine the success or failure of intestinal maturation following bacterial colonization may lead to treatments for devastating conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis.\n","date":1545109200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545109200,"objectID":"9fcab7cfa9a7e4c5d0b5fab67151e10e","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/project/hios/","publishdate":"2018-12-18T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/hios/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding the mechanisms guiding the establishment of host-microbial symbiosis using stem-cell derived intestinal tissues","tags":["HIOs"],"title":"Modeling Neonatal Microbial Colonization in Human Intestinal Organoids","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["David R Hill","Sha Huang","Melinda S Nagy","Veda K Yadagiri","Courtney Fields","Dishari Mukherjee","Brooke Bons","Priya H Dedhia","Alana M Chin","Yu-Hwai Tsai","Shrikar Thodla","Thomas M Schmidt","Seth Walk","Vincent B Young","Jason R Spence"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1510030800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510030800,"objectID":"919ee985291b365b5bedbaecfb8add4d","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/publication/elife_2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/elife_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The human gastrointestinal tract is immature at birth, yet must adapt to dramatic changes such as oral nutrition and microbial colonization. The confluence of these factors can lead to severe inflammatory disease in premature infants; however, investigating complex environment-host interactions is difficult due to limited access to immature human tissue. Here, we demonstrate that the epithelium of human pluripotent stem-cell-derived human intestinal organoids is globally similar to the immature human epithelium and we utilize HIOs to investigate complex host-microbe interactions in this naive epithelium. Our findings demonstrate that the immature epithelium is intrinsically capable of establishing a stable host-microbe symbiosis. Microbial colonization leads to complex contact and hypoxia driven responses resulting in increased antimicrobial peptide production, maturation of the mucus layer, and improved barrier function. These studies lay the groundwork for an improved mechanistic understanding of how colonization influences development of the immature human intestine.","tags":[],"title":"Bacterial colonization stimulates a complex physiological response in the immature human intestinal epithelium","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"4f16f94dd09dca11ef9898c247bfbc10","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/project/hio-microinjection/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/hio-microinjection/","section":"project","summary":"This protocol describes the measurement of epithelial barrier permeability in real-time following pharmacologic treatment in human intestinal organoids using fluorescent microscopy and live cell microscopy","tags":["HIOs","reproducible research"],"title":"Real-time measurement of epithelial barrier permeability in human intestinal organoids","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
