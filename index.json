Although I\u0026rsquo;ve had some experience assisting with both undergraduate and graduate level courses in the past, this was my first experience as the course director and sole instructor for a college-level course. The whole process was exciting, challenging, and, ultimately, personally rewarding. It reinforced my long-standing enthusiasm for teaching and led to a number of important insights for me personally and professionally.\nAs we reached the end of the semester I reflected back on what advice I might like to pass on to the students in my class before sending them on their way. Smashed in there at the tail end of a final lecture on vaccines and public health policy, I shared a single slide and a few remarks as a way of saying \u0026ldquo;Thanks and Good Luck\u0026rdquo;.\nNote that this is not intended as some kind of all-encompassing life philosophy or guide\u0026hellip; just three bits of personal insight for the road ahead to take or leave as you please. So here goes:\n Take pride in your work. Even many years into his retirement, my grandfather worked everyday. I remember helping him clean up in the yard. He would pile up all the fallen limbs and sticks and then cut them into lengths of exactly one foot, sort them by diameter, and then arrange them into equal bundles tied up with twine. Similarly, cardboard scraps from the house would be cut into squares, stacked, and tied up with twine before going out on the tree lawn for recycling collection. As a kid I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why would he waste all his time on that? Why not just throw it all in a bag like everybody else?\u0026rdquo;. Many years later the meaning of his efforts dawned on me: not every task is interesting or exciting or fun. But when you take pride in your work, even the most menial task, you give it significance. Whether it be gathering twigs in the yard or cleaning test tubes in your first research position, a job well done is a small gesture through which we say to ourselves and to others I care.\n Hold the door open for others. Michelle Obama said it best : \u0026ldquo;[W]hen you\u0026rsquo;ve worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you. You reach back and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed.\u0026rdquo; This is especially true in academia. If you\u0026rsquo;re here it\u0026rsquo;s because you have enjoyed some special privileges in life. The ability to get an education, perhaps connections to others in academia, or maybe just somebody who told you that you had it in you to do this. As you move up through academic life, others will come to you looking for help. Take a moment to pass on some words of encouragement. Of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve done in my career, I\u0026rsquo;m most proud of the small roles I\u0026rsquo;ve played in others\u0026rsquo; successes - students who got into Medical or Graduate school, who got scholarships or grants, or who found a job. These moments make it all worthwhile.\n The future is uncertain; Trust that you will be able to figure it out when you get there. Although it remains a popular line of questioning in job interviews and admissions processes, none of us knows where we are going to be in 5-10 years time. You can make the most comprehensive of plans, map out every aspect of your life and put all your various ducks in a perfect row and still many of the factors that determine whether those plans ultimately become reality will remain outside of your control. Uncertainty about the future is a big part of life in academia, where we sink or swim based on the whims of anonymous reviewers. But you\u0026rsquo;re a survivor. You\u0026rsquo;ve gone through who knows what to get where you are today. When challenges came, you figured it out. Or maybe you didn\u0026rsquo;t. Maybe you really screwed up somewhere. You are human; failing at stuff is part of the deal. But whatever happened, you got here. And you can do it again. And again. And again\u0026hellip;\n  ","date":1545368400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546837200,"objectID":"1a69092f144e27b7c0c07461eeda4834","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/post/teaching/end_of_year_advice/","publishdate":"2018-12-21T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/teaching/end_of_year_advice/","section":"post","summary":"Last winter I served as course director for Clinical Immunology at Eastern Michigan University\u0026rsquo;s School of Health Sciences.

Intestinal epithelial cells in the lab express antimicrobial peptides when provoked because presumably this response is a property of all intestinal epithelial cells. Or, taking a more classical example, a feather and a cannonball fall to the earth at the same rate in a vacuum because acceleration due to gravity acts on them equally. For science to be useful these observations must be true in every case where identical conditions are present.\nReplicating experimental conditions exactly has always been difficult. The problem is particularly significant in the biomedical sciences where the conditions to replicate an experiment may require specialized skills, equipment, and reagents. And in many cases the experimental conditions may not be well defined, or may not be completely definable within the current limitations of our understanding. Consider the complexity of a single bacterial cell: even E. coli/ K-12, perhaps the single best characterized organism known to science, behaves in ways that do not fit our current understanding or predictions. This type of failure of reproducibility is intrinsic to science; we simply don\u0026rsquo;t know what we don\u0026rsquo;t know. Early attempts at skin grafts were widely variable, with some surgeons publishing anecdotal reports of complete success and others reporting the miserable failure of these techniques. At the time, the HLA system was entirely unknown and the notion that we might match donor and recipient tissues according to some biological criteria didn\u0026rsquo;t exist. The contrast between successful skin grants and failed skin grafts and the investigations that followed eventually resulted in the HLA tissue typing system that has enabled modern tissue transplant procedures and has by now saved many thousands of lives.\nA second and more commonplace challenge to reproducibility are simple lapses in our technique: memories fail, training quality varies, files get deleted and notebooks get lost. People drop test tubes, knock over the Bunsen burner, contaminate the cell culture, and just generally behave like the imperfect beings we always will be. The solutions here are as simple as the explanations: keep better documentation and try again until you get it right. Well\u0026hellip; simple in concept, if not in practice.\nA third challenge to reproducibility is more insidious. Many scientific observations are subject to a certain degree of interpretation. Two reasonable scientists can disagree on the best statistical test for a given hypothesis. One scientist may think that removal of certain samples from analysis is justified while another may disagree. On their own these kinds of debates are not harmful. Things get complicated of course when we consider the potential for conflicts of interest between the interpretation of scientific results and the prospects for career-making publications and grant applications. The unfortunate truth is that our scientific results are not entirely independent of our career trajectory, despite good science demanding that the experimental design and interpretation be independent of personal and political concerns. Many solutions have been proposed to this conundrum over the years, and there are many broad scale changes to our system that I would personally support but will not elaborate on here\nFor now, my aims are more localized. For the past several years I have invested time and effort in developing a workflow for documenting my experiments and data analysis in a system that allows anyone to generate the same results from the raw data files and to follow my explicit rationale, as documented in computer code, for every step of the process. This series of blog posts will address my efforts to tackle reproducibility in my own work by producing better and more accessible documentation of methods and maximum transparency in data analysis. My hope is that these posts can serve as a teaching resource for members of my research team and the larger community.\n","date":1545109200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545109200,"objectID":"5f3bf89d6ea6ad918516f1322d5725df","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/project/reproducible_research/","publishdate":"2018-12-18T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/reproducible_research/","section":"project","summary":"This series of blog posts will address my efforts to tackle reproducibility in my own work by producing better and more accessible documentation of methods and maximum transparency in data analysis","tags":["reproducible-research","emacs"],"title":"A System for Reproducible Research","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"All multicellular organisms have a problem: surviving in a world that is already fully occupied by bacteria and other single celled organisms. We call this problem symbiosis. The primary solution to this problem is mutualism, which intimately links the survival of individual organisms and as a result has shaped the evolution of both bacterial and multicellular life.\nThis interplay is central to the maturation and function of the human gastrointestinal tract. Our guts are colonized by mutualistic and other bacteria at birth. These bacteria come from a variety of sources, including our moms and other family members, our environment, and the things we eat early in life. Once these bacteria arrive in our guts, some of them grow rapidly and begin to form dense communities with increasing abilities to help us process the food we eat, regulate our immune response, and many other functions that we have recently begun to understand. At the same time, our intestines are maturing rapidly by generating digestive cells, secreting protective mucus and antimicrobial compounds, and formulating adaptive immune protections that will affect us for the rest of our lives.\nThe interplay between microbial colonization and expansion in the gut and the development of the gut itself has been difficult to study. There are no germ-free human research subjects. In my research I apply innovate cell culture model systems that allow us to grow germ-free human intestinal tissue in the lab. Our work has shown that these tissues can sustain symbiosis with mutualistic bacteria and that this relationship kickstarts maturation of the lining of the human intestine.\nI am currently using this system to explore the factors that contribute to the failure of the intestinal maturation in some premature infants. Identification of specific conditions that determine the success or failure of intestinal maturation following bacterial colonization may lead to treatments for devastating conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis.\n","date":1545109200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545109200,"objectID":"9fcab7cfa9a7e4c5d0b5fab67151e10e","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/project/hios/","publishdate":"2018-12-18T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/hios/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding the mechanisms guiding the establishment of host-microbial symbiosis using stem-cell derived intestinal tissues","tags":["HIOs"],"title":"Modeling Neonatal Microbial Colonization in Human Intestinal Organoids","type":"project"},{"authors":["David R.

Leveraging these emerging model systems will require adaptation of tools and techniques developed for 2D culture systems and animals. Here, we describe a technique for measuring epithelial barrier permeability in human intestinal organoids in real-time. This is accomplished by microinjection of fluorescently-labeled dextran and imaging on an inverted microscope fitted with epifluorescent filters. Real-time measurement of the barrier permeability in intestinal organoids facilitates the generation of high-resolution temporal data in human intestinal epithelial tissue, although this technique can also be applied to fixed timepoint imaging approaches. This protocol is readily adaptable for the measurement of epithelial barrier permeability following exposure to pharmacologic agents, bacterial products or toxins, or live microorganisms. With minor modifications, this protocol can also serve as a general primer on microinjection of intestinal organoids and users may choose to supplement this protocol with additional or alternative downstream applications following microinjection.","tags":["HIOs","reproducible research"],"title":"Real-time Measurement of Epithelial Barrier Permeability in Human Intestinal Organoids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David R Hill","Sha Huang","Melinda S Nagy","Veda K Yadagiri","Courtney Fields","Dishari Mukherjee","Brooke Bons","Priya H Dedhia","Alana M Chin","Yu-Hwai Tsai","Shrikar Thodla","Thomas M Schmidt","Seth Walk","Vincent B Young","Jason R Spence"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510030800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510030800,"objectID":"919ee985291b365b5bedbaecfb8add4d","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/publication/elife_2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/elife_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The human gastrointestinal tract is immature at birth, yet must adapt to dramatic changes such as oral nutrition and microbial colonization. The confluence of these factors can lead to severe inflammatory disease in premature infants; however, investigating complex environment-host interactions is difficult due to limited access to immature human tissue. Here, we demonstrate that the epithelium of human pluripotent stem-cell-derived human intestinal organoids is globally similar to the immature human epithelium and we utilize HIOs to investigate complex host-microbe interactions in this naive epithelium. Our findings demonstrate that the immature epithelium is intrinsically capable of establishing a stable host-microbe symbiosis. Microbial colonization leads to complex contact and hypoxia driven responses resulting in increased antimicrobial peptide production, maturation of the mucus layer, and improved barrier function. These studies lay the groundwork for an improved mechanistic understanding of how colonization influences development of the immature human intestine.","tags":["HIOs"],"title":"Bacterial colonization stimulates a complex physiological response in the immature human intestinal epithelium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David R Hill","Jason R Spence"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510030800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510030800,"objectID":"66e9a40de083d48163243c9245cfff4f","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/publication/cmgh_2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cmgh_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to the concept that microorganisms play an integral role in human physiology and pathophysiology. Despite this, the molecular basis of host–pathogen and host–symbiont interactions in the human intestine remains poorly understood owing to the limited availability of human tissue, and the biological complexity of host–microbe interactions. Over the past decade, technological advances have enabled long-term culture of organotypic intestinal tissue derived from human subjects and from human pluripotent stem cells, and these in vitro culture systems already have shown the potential to inform our understanding significantly of host-microbe interactions. Gastrointestinal organoids represent a substantial advance in structural and functional complexity over traditional in vitro cell culture models of the human gastrointestinal epithelium while retaining much of the genetic and molecular tractability that makes in vitro experimentation so appealing. The opportunity to model epithelial barrier dynamics, cellular differentiation, and proliferation more accurately in specific intestinal segments and in tissue containing a proportional representation of the diverse epithelial subtypes found in the native gut greatly enhances the translational potential of organotypic gastrointestinal culture systems. By using these tools, researchers have uncovered novel aspects of host–pathogen and host–symbiont interactions with the intestinal epithelium. Application of these tools promises to reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of infectious disease, inflammation, cancer, and the role of microorganisms in intestinal development. This review summarizes research on the use of gastrointestinal organoids as a model of the host–microbe interface.","tags":["HIOs"],"title":"Gastrointestinal Organoids: Understanding the Molecular Basis of the Host–Microbe Interface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D R Hill","S Huang","M S Nagy","V K Yadagiri","C Fields","D Mukherjee","B Bons","P H Dedhia","A M Chin","Y H Tsai","S Thodla","T M Schmidt","S Walk","V B Young","J R Spence"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"316c422b19e903079b2504de14ae4fff","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/publication/my-md-folder/2017-01-01_hill2017a/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/my-md-folder/2017-01-01_hill2017a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bacterial colonization stimulates a complex physiological response in the immature human intestinal epithelium.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D R Hill","J R Spence"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"3a15777d76ad8452c31aec6f8e27a204","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/publication/my-md-folder/2017-01-01_hill2017b/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/my-md-folder/2017-01-01_hill2017b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Gastrointestinal Organoids: Understanding the Molecular Basis of the Host-Microbe Interface.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A M Chin","D R Hill","M Aurora","J R Spence"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"02a6a5d60694312de4ac0bc98439115e","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/publication/my-md-folder/2017-01-01_chin2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/my-md-folder/2017-01-01_chin2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Morphogenesis and maturation of the embryonic and postnatal intestine.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D R Hill","S Huang","Y H Tsai","J R Spence","V B Young"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"1232d208528cec1db7b09cd6ba3dd199","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/publication/my-md-folder/2017-01-01_hill2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/my-md-folder/2017-01-01_hill2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Real-time Measurement of Epithelial Barrier Permeability in Human Intestinal Organoids.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"4f16f94dd09dca11ef9898c247bfbc10","permalink":"https://hilldr.github.io/project/hio-microinjection/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/hio-microinjection/","section":"project","summary":"This protocol describes the measurement of epithelial barrier permeability in real-time following pharmacologic treatment in human intestinal organoids using fluorescent microscopy and live cell microscopy","tags":["HIOs","reproducible research"],"title":"Real-time measurement of epithelial barrier permeability in human intestinal organoids","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yu-Hwai Tsai","David R.

You can also read a Q\u0026A I did with the Lasker Foundation in 2016 here.\nAlthough rotation of the earth around the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took Galileo's telescope and Newton's laws of gravitation to demonstrate that heliocentric theory was irrefutably true. Likewise, although Darwin proposed natural selection as the means by which species originated and demonstrated that the natural world was consistent with this hypothesis, the work of Watson, Crick, and Wilkins elucidated the biochemical foundation of trait inheritance. The same opportunity to understand for the first time the mechanistic basis of an eminently significant natural phenomena now presents itself with regards to the integration of microbial symbionts and their human partners.\nRecent developments are redefining the role for microorganisms in human health and disease. All multicellular organisms harbor a vast population of bacteria and other microorganisms and form symbiotic partnerships with at least some of their microbial inhabitants. This symbiosis is the product of an eons long and intimately intertwined evolutionary journey, producing a human host and microbial partners whose integrated function is a mutual necessity (1). A human being is thus better defined in its totality as a \"metaorganism\" composed of not one but many unique and complementary co-evolved genomes (2). The rules which guide the assembly and integrated function of the multi-organismal human being remain almost entirely unknown.\nMounting evidence suggests that dysfunction of the human-microbial symbiosis is a major driver in the pathogenesis of the most common ailments affecting mankind, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and even psychiatric disorders. We now know that germ-free laboratory animals are susceptible to gastrointestinal cancer brought on by exposure environmental carcinogens, suggesting that metabolism of exogenous toxins by the microbial community serves an important protection against the most damaging carcinogens. Microbes residing in the gut exert a systemic influence on carcinogenesis in organs that do not harbor a large number of indigenous microbes, and manipulation of the gut microbiota with antibiotics has been shown to reduce tumorigenesis in the liver, lung and breast in animal studies (3). Outgrowth of specific microbes may be an early indicator of minute changes within a patient. New clinical screening tools that evaluate the composition of the microbiome have recently been shown to improve identification of colorectal adenoma by more than 50-fold relative to screening based on algorithms incorporating all previously known risk factors (4).\nThe intestinal microbiota serves as the critical link between obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, all among the greatest heath challenges of the 21st century (5). Obesity and type 2 diabetes, often attributed to a high fat and high carbohydrate diet, result in changes in intestinal microbiome composition and altered production of microbial metabolites. In an outstanding recent report, a single microbial metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) distributed systemically in the circulatory system was found to be a major predictor of heart attack, stroke, and overall mortality among human patients (6). Evidence that dietary changes associated with protection from cardiovascular disease reduce the generation of TMAO by the human gut microbiota provide tantalizing evidence that metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease may be preventable by manipulation of the gut microbiota.\nA new appreciation for the role of microbial activity in cognition is reshaping traditional neuroscience. Behavioral conditions, in particular autism and schizophrenia, are associated with altered microbial composition. Direct signaling through the vagus nerve, systemic immune trafficking, or the dissemination of microbial metabolites have all been proposed as mechanistic bases for an apparent gut-brain signaling axis (7). Perhaps the most compelling findings on the neurocognitive influence of our microbial symbionts stems from research on the ubiquitous protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, commonly transferred to human hosts via domesticated cats. Colonization with T. gondii occurs in the central nervous system and is associated with risk taking behavior, depression, and even schizophrenic events (8). This leads naturally to the uncomfortable implication that microbial symbionts influence human behavior and perhaps lends credence to once-antiquated references to \"gut feelings\". An understanding of the interdependent nature of microbial and eukaryotic life fundamentally challenges the natural view of the individual as a self-directed being.\nGiven the startling complexity of a human microbial community containing up to 5,000 species and 100 trillion individual organisms, it is perhaps not entirely surprising that the mechanistic basis of these associations remain poorly defined. We cannot claim to understand the human metaorganism without understanding its microbial inhabitants in all their myriad complexity. The significance of the combined activity of the microbiome has been likened to the discovery of a new organ system. Reflecting upon his first comprehension of the astounding intricacy of the circulatory system, physician William Harvey wrote in his 1628 treatise On the motion of the Heart and Blood:\n\"...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the heart was only to be comprehended by God.\"\nDespite Dr. Harvey's initial misgivings, here we stand in a world in which lifesaving re-routing of the circulation is conducted routinely, in which life can be extended and even improved through the use of artificial hearts, and in which statins can preclude the blockage of circulation, in the words of Carl Sagan, eventually saving \"more lives than have been lost in all the wars in history\". The same opportunity now presents itself in the form of the emerging science of human-microbial symbiosis. Medicine must and will adapt to this revolution in our understanding of the human patient as the unique result of the integrated function of perhaps thousands of distinct organisms, each with its own physiology, life cycle, and evolutionary history. We may one day find ourselves in a world in which therapies directed at the human microbiome restore health and vitality in millions of patients every year. Yet in the midst of this great promise, advances in technology indisputably place the responsibility to pursue this future upon the present generation of scientists and physicians. Investment in multidisciplinary approaches aimed at elucidating the mechanistic underpinnings of human-microbial symbiosis in health and disease will repay all of mankind abundantly in the decades to come.\n McFall-Ngai, M. et al.
