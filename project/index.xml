      <description>A fundamental assumption that serves as the philosophical engine of modern science is that the phenomena we observe and measure in the lab are representative of universal phenomena. Intestinal epithelial cells in the lab express antimicrobial peptides when provoked because presumably this response is a property of all intestinal epithelial cells. Or, taking a more classical example, a feather and a cannonball fall to the earth at the same rate in a vacuum because acceleration due to gravity acts on them equally.</description>

      <description>All multicellular organisms have a problem: surviving in a world that is already fully occupied by bacteria and other single celled organisms. We call this problem symbiosis. The primary solution to this problem is mutualism, which intimately links the survival of individual organisms and as a result has shaped the evolution of both bacterial and multicellular life.
This interplay is central to the maturation and function of the human gastrointestinal tract.</description>
